Spatial TODO List
=================

Minor version updates
--------------------

1. Some test cases now require lots of RAM to compile, therefore we
   need to break things up.

3. Support for C++11 initializer lists

4. Support C++11 for loops will require a redesign of iterator
   interface.

Major version update
--------------------

6. Prompting the user to use Comparator in point_multiset<>,
   point_multimap<> and other container creates a need to rebind a
   difference for euclidian, quadrance and manathan metrics. If the
   user was simply asked for an assessor right from the start, this
   need would not exists. This will require a redesign and break of
   interface for the metrics. Metric can then be abbrievated with:
           neighbor_begin<euclidian<float> >(container, target);
   Instead of:
           euclidian_neighbor_begin(container, target);
   Which does not allow the user to customize the type used to express
   distance.
   This would also deprecate all metric specialization of
   neighbor_begin(), neighbor_lower_bound(), etc. Ultimately, this
   will resolve into less code and thus simplify support.

7. Modify the interface for box_multiset and box_multimap which does
   not allow for flexibility with enclosed_region and
   overlapping_region. This would require a redesign of the
   box_multiset and box_multimap, to store a pair<key_type> for each
   box. Defining box_multiset would then be put into
   question. Ultimately this would result into less code as well.

8. Create the cache-oblivious point_index and box_index once the above
   is done. Which would be a real achievement at this point. Index are
   flat array representation of the tree which maintain perfect
   balancing. It is also more economical in memory since only 1
   pointer per node need to be defined (pointer to parent). Finally,
   it is cache oblivious because for any cache size, there should
   exist a sub-set of the array that contains a sub-tree that fits
   entirely in the cache. This container would replace idle_* family
   of containers.

9. Adding iterator_cast() operators to ensure that iterator conversion
   is not done unknowingly as it is the case today.


Spatial Miscellanelous
======================

* Move the repository to Github which is more social and dynamic.

* Complete General doxygen documention with details on container and
  views, elaboration of how to write geometry, etc.

* Work on adding performance-based tests and comparison with other
  libraries in the market, not just libkdtree++. Wouldn't it be nice
  to see how it fares against FLANN or Boost.Rtree?

* In relaxed kdtree, when inserting a point, during rebalancing, if
  the node to insert is in the interval of the imbalanced node and the
  candidate found, then the node to insert itself should become the
  new root. Then only insert the imbalanced node.

* Addition of algorithms. A few come to mind: approximative nearest
  neighbor search, min/max depth, etc.

* Creating by-project to wrap spatial in python, java, ruby, etc?
